### Overview

Automatically import App Store reviews into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.

When setting up the connection, you'll have the option to select specific apps to sync reviews from, and you can also select how far back you'd like to import existing data from.

### Set up App Store integration

You can set up your App Store integration from Settings, when creating a new Channel, or want to Add source to an existing channel set up in your workspace.
- To do this, set up your Channel and select App Store in the Connect data source modal. This will require you to accept the required permissions, enter your developer name and select your apps.
- Next, enter the Key ID, Issuer ID, and .P8 file from App Store and click Next.
- From there, choose your apps to pull data in from and confirm the connection.

### Import reviews automatically to Channels

Once you have connected your App Store account to Dovetail, you can sync reviews into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes.
- To do this, set up your Channel and select App Store in the Connect data source modal.
- Next, select the apps you wish to sync reviews from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select Finish. Once complete, reviews will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new reviews when received.

Along with the review comment itself, we will automatically sync in metadata related to the review if available. This includes `Reviewer name`, `Rating`, `Device`, `App version`, `Thumbs up count` and `Thumbs down count`, and `Reviewer language`.
