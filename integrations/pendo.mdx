## Overview

Automatically import Pendo Listen product feedback into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.

When setting up the connection, you'll have the option to select specific apps to sync reviews from, and you can also select how far back you'd like to import existing data from.

## Set up Pendo integration

You can set up your Pendo integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when creating a new Channel, or want to `Add source` to an existing channel set up in your workspace.

- To do this, set up your Channel and select`Pendo` in the Connect data source modal. This will require you to accept the required permissions.

## Import feedback automatically to Channels

Once you have connected your Pendo Listen account to Dovetail, you can sync feedback into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes.

- To do this, open or create a new Channel and add`Pendo`as a data source.
- Next, select the apps you wish to sync reviews from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select `Finish`. Once complete, reviews will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new reviews when received.

Along with the review comment itself, we will automatically sync in metadata related to the review if available. This includes `Effort`, `Impact`, `Type`, and `Created by type`.
