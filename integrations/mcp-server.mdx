## Overview

Streamline access to customer intelligence with the Dovetail MCP server. Designed for efficiency and seamless integration, the Dovetail MCP server enables AI models to securely access and search your Dovetail workspace.

This STDIO-based server implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) specification, allowing you to use Dovetail's capabilities in MCP-compatible tools like Claude Desktop and Cursor. It has tools available for finding, creating, and updating objects in Dovetail like projects and insights — with more functionality on the way. Our MCP server is available on all plans.

## Get started with Dovetail's MCP server

To get started, navigate to [Settings → Account](https://dovetail.com/settings/user/account), look for Personal API keys, and generate a token. This token will let you query and update data available to your user account. Data you do not have access to and actions that aren’t available to your user role will not be available when using your personal API key.
