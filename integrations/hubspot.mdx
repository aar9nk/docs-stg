## Overview

Automatically import HubSpot Service Hub tickets into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.

When setting up the connection, you'll have the option to select specific apps to sync tickets from, and you can also select how far back you'd like to import existing data from.

## Set up HubSpot integration

You can set up your HubSpot Service Hub integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when creating a new Channel, or by selecting Add source on an existing Channel in your workspace.

- To do this, set up your Channel and select `HubSpot Service Hub` in the Connect data source modal. You’ll be prompted to log in to your HubSpot account and accept the required permissions to authorize access.
- Next, select the inboxes you'd like to pull conversations from as well as how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm the setup and click `Complete`.

## Import tickets automatically to Channels

After connecting your HubSpot Service Hub account, Dovetail will automatically sync conversations into your selected Channel. These will be stored, analyzed, summarized, and organized into themes.

- To do this, open or create a new Channel and add`HubSpot`as a data source.
- Next, select the inbox/s you wish to sync tickets from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select `Finish`. Once complete, reviews will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new reviews when received.

Note: If you don't have any conversations, the integration won’t return results. Make sure the inboxes you connect have at least some recent conversation threads.

Along with the ticket itself, we will automatically sync in metadata related to the review if available. This includes `Inbox ID`, `Channel ID`, `Status` and`Assigned to`.

This metadata is stored alongside the full message content, allowing you to analyze support conversations with full context.
