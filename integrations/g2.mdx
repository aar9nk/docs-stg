### Overview
Overview
Automatically import G2 reviews into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.
When setting up the connection, you'll have the option to select specific apps to sync reviews from, and you can also select how far back you'd like to import existing data from.

### Set up G2 integration
You can set up your G2 integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when creating a new Channel, or when you `Add source` to an existing channel set up in your workspace.
- To do this, set up your Channel and select `G2` in the Connect data source modal.
- In a separate window, navigate to your G2 integrations page and copy your API key. Paste this back into Dovetail and press `Continue`

### Import reviews automatically to Channels
Once you have connected your G2 account to Dovetail, you can sync reviews into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes.
- To do this, open or create a new Channel and add `G2` as a data source.
- Next, select the apps you wish to sync reviews from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select `Finish`. Once complete, reviews will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new reviews when received.

Along with the review comment itself, we will automatically sync in metadata related to the review if available. This  includes `Reviewer name`, `Reviewer company`, and `Reviewer title`.
