### Troubleshooting your Google Drive imports
#### Size limits
If you are importing a Google cloud document, sheet, slide or drawing, please be aware there is a 10MB size limit.
#### Permissions and access
When integrating Google Drive for the first time, please ensure that you allow Dovetail to **'See and download all your Google Drive files'** when prompted.

If you are importing a file from Google Drive that has been shared with you by another owner, please be aware of the file access permissions.

In Google Drive, there is an option for owners to prevent people from re-sharing, downloading, printing, or copying the file or changing access permissions. Unfortunately, this will also prevent the file from being successfully imported into Dovetail if you do not have the correct access.

To troubleshoot this, file access permissions will need to be amended by the original file owner. To amend a file's access permissions for a viewer or commenter on Google Drive, open the file in Google Drive, right-click to open **Share** settings and enable **Viewers and commenters can see the option to download, print, and copy** for the file.
