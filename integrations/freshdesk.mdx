### Overview
Connect your Freshdesk account to [Channels](/help/channels/channels.mdx) to automatically ingest and analyze support tickets. Once connected, tickets will sync into Channels where theyâ€™ll be grouped into themes, sentiment analyzed, and tracked over time, no manual tagging or reading required.
This integration helps support, product, and CX teams identify trends, spot recurring issues, and bring high-volume feedback closer to decision-making.

### Set up Freshdesk integration
You can set up your Freshdesk integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when create a new Channel, or want to `Add source` to an existing channel set up in your workspace.
- To do this, set up your Channel and select `Freskdesk` in the **Connect data source** modal. This will require you to review and accept the required permissions.
- From there, enter your Freshdesk **domain** (e.g. `yourcompany.freshdesk.com`) and paste your **API key** from Freshdesk. You can find this by going to your Freshdesk profile â†’ **API key**.

### Import issues automatically to Channels
Once you have connected your Freshdesk Account to Dovetail, you can sync support tickets received in Front into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes. 
- To do this, open or create a new Channel for `Support tickets` and add `Freshdesk` as a **data source**.
- Next, select the Freshdesk **groups** inboxes you wish to sync issues from as well as: 
  - **Ticket status** (e.g. open, resolved, closed).
  - **Backfill range** to import past tickets (e.g. last 30, 60, or 90 days).
- From there, confirm set up and select `Finish`. Once complete, data from Freshdesk will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new issues into your Channel when received in Freshdesk.
