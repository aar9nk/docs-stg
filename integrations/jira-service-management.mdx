## Overview

Automatically import Jira Service Management issues into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.

When setting up the connection, you'll have the option to select specific inboxes to sync tickets from, and you can also select how far back you'd like to import existing data from.

## Set up Jira integration

You can set up your Jira integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when create a new Channel, or want to `Add source` to an existing channel set up in your workspace.

- To do this, set up your Channel and select `Jira` in the Connect data source modal. This will require you to review and accept the required permissions.

## Import issues automatically to Channels

Once you have connected your Jira Account to Dovetail, you can sync support tickets received in Jira into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes.

- To do this, open or create a new Channel for `Support tickets` and add `Jira` as a data source.
- Next, select the inboxes you wish to sync issues from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select `Finish`. Once complete, data from Jira will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new issues into your Channel when received in Jira.
