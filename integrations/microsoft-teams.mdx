## Set up Teams integration

<Note>
  If you are setting up the Teams integration for the first time, there are a few things to be aware of including:

  1. It's common that Teams workspace owners may have [turned on app approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies) to require admin approval for installing new apps, including Dovetail. If this is the case for your Teams workspace, we recommend seeking approval from your internal IT team and sharing this article to provide an outline of the integration's capability and [requested permissions](https://dovetail.com/help/integrations/microsoft-teams/#requested-permissions).
  2. If using Ask Dovetail in Teams, only users with a Dovetail admin role can enable the integration in Dovetail. Non-admin users will not be able to view or configure the integration.
</Note>

If Dovetail is an approved app for your Teams workspace, you can connect your Teams account to receive notifications, share data, and engage with comments from your Dovetail workspace.

- To connect your Teams account to Dovetail, select ⚙️ [Settings → Integrations](https://dovetail.com/settings/user/integrations) in the sidebar and navigate to Microsoft Teams in the integrations list
- From there, select `Connect` and toggle on Product notifications. To confirm the connection, you will then be prompted to log in to your Microsoft Teams account and review requested permissions.

If you get an error saying 'No organization found for this Microsoft Teams account', this means you've tried to integrate with a personal Microsoft account which our app does not support.

## Set up to import Teams recordings

Connecting Teams along with your Outlook Calendar accounts means you'll no longer need to import recorded meetings manually. You can configure which calendar you'd like to pull event recordings from, define any keywords that meeting titles must contain, and select which project you'd like events to be imported into.

- To do this, navigate to [Settings → Integrations](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations) and click on `Outlook Calendar`.
- Click `Connect` and sign in/select the Microsoft account that you wish to authenticate.
- From there, select your video source as Microsoft Teams and continue to authenticate.
- Once you have authenticated your Teams source, select your desired calendar, and project that you want your Teams recordings to be imported to, and press `Save`.

<Warning>
  There may be times that your internal Microsoft Teams Workspace has settings preventing the integration from being able to access the Teams authentication. To troubleshoot this, you will have to contact your Teams admin or IT department first to ensure that the Dovetail integration is on the "allow" list.
</Warning>

## Share content in Microsoft Teams

When you share a Dovetail link in Microsoft Teams, all the relevant information related to the link will be displayed directly in Microsoft Teams for you and your colleagues to see.

The supported links are notes, highlights, tags, insights, project readme, and people.

#### Share a highlight

When you share a highlight, you will also get a video embed of the highlight that your team can play right from Microsoft Teams.

If you are using the desktop or mobile app, to play the highlight you'll need to go through an authentication flow.

- To do this, copy the link provided, paste it into your browser, and login to Dovetail.
- From there, copy the one-time password (OTP) then enter the OTP in Microsoft Teams.

## Ask questions to Dovetail in Teams
