## Overview

Automatically import Zendesk tickets into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.

When setting up the connection, you'll have the option to select specific inboxes to sync tickets from, and you can also select how far back you'd like to import existing data from.

## Set up Zendesk integration

You can set up your Zendesk integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when create a new Channel, or want to `Add source` to an existing channel set up in your workspace.

- To do this, set up your Channel and select `Zendesk` in the Connect data source modal. This will require you to review and accept the required permissions.

<Note>
  To connect an external data source, you'll need access to it to authorize the specific permissions that Dovetail requires. If you don't have the correct level of access and are unable to authorize, you'll need to reach out to an internal team that can provide you with the correct access.
</Note>

## Import tickets automatically to Channels

Once you have connected your Zendesk Account to Dovetail, you can sync support tickets received in Zendesk into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes.

- To do this, open or create a new Channel for `Support tickets and` add `Zendesk` as a data source.
- Next, select the inboxes you wish to sync tickets from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select `Finish`. Once complete, data from Zendesk will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new tickets into your Channel when received in Zendesk.
