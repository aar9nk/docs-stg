### Set up Front integration
You can set up your Front integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when create a new Channel, or want to `Add source` to an existing channel set up in your workspace.
- To do this, set up your Channel and select `Front` in the **Connect data source** modal. This will require you to review and accept the required permissions.

<Card title="Connect and authorize data source">
  To connect an external data source, you'll need access to it to authorize the specific permissions that Dovetail requires. If you don't have the correct level of access and are unable to authorize, you'll need to reach out to an internal team that can provide you with the correct access.

### Import tickets automatically to Channels
Once you have connected your Front Account to Dovetail, you can sync support tickets received in Front into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes. 
- To do this, open or create a new Channel and add `Front` as a **data source**.
- Next, select the inboxes you wish to sync tickets from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
