### Overview
Automatically import Google Calendar events into projects, where they'll be transcribed and summarized.

### Set up Google Calendar integration
Connecting your Google Calendar and Dovetail accounts means you'll no longer need to import recorded meetings manually. You can configure which calendar you'd like to pull event recordings from, define any keywords that meeting titles must contain, and select which project you'd like events to be imported into.
You'll also need to connect your Dovetail account with whatever video conferencing tool you use so that all of the required event information can be imported.
- To do this, navigate to [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations) and click on `Google Calendar`.
- Click `Connect` and sign in/select the Microsoft account that you wish to authenticate.
- From there, select your video source as [Zoom](/help/zoom/zoom.mdx) and continue to authenticate.
- Once you have authenticated your video source, select your desired calendar and project that you want your call recordings to be imported to, and press `Save`.

<Tip>If you'd only like specific events to be imported to Dovetail, you can enter specific keywords within the configuration modal under the 'Event title must contain' field!</Tip>
