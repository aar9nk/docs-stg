## Set up Outlook Calendar integration

Connecting your Outlook Calendar and Dovetail accounts means you'll no longer need to import recorded meetings manually. You can configure which calendar you'd like to pull event recordings from, define any keywords that meeting titles must contain, and select which project you'd like events to be imported into.

- Navigate to ⚙️ [Settings → Integrations](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations) and click on `Outlook Calendar`.
- Click `Connect` and sign in/select the Microsoft account that you wish to authenticate.
- From there, select your video source as [Microsoft Teams](https://dovetail.com/help/integrate-with-microsoft-teams/) or [Zoom](https://dovetail.com/help/import-zoom-cloud-recordings/) and continue to authenticate.
- Once you have authenticated your video source, select your desired calendar and project that you want your call recordings to be imported to, and press `Save`.
