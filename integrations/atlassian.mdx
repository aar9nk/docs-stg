Overview

With our Atlassian integration, you can embed highlights and reels from Projects directly in Confluence, Jira, and Trello. You can also automatically import Jira issues into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.

## Import Jira issues automatically to Channels

Connect Jira Service Management to Dovetail to sync support issues created in Jira into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes.

- To do this, open or create a new Channel for `Support tickets and` add `Jira` as a data source.
- Next, select the projects you wish to sync tickets from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select `Finish`. Once complete, data from Jira will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new tickets into your Channel when received in Jira.

## Share highlight reels from Projects

Embed a video or audio highlight or reel from a project by copying and pasting a link into a Confluence page, Jira issue, or Trello card. This video can be played directly in Confluence, Jira or Trello.

- To do this, open Dovetail to copy a link of your highlight or reel.
- Next, paste this link into a Confluence page, Jira issue, or Trello card.
- From there, continue to `Connect your Dovetail account`. Once you can have accepted the requested permissions, your highlight or reel will unfurl and show a preview you can watch directly in your tool.
