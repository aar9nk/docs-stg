## Overview

Automatically import Intercom tickets into Channels in real-time, where they'll be automatically analyzed and classified into themes, allowing you to track trends over time.

When setting up the connection, you'll have the option to select specific inboxes to sync tickets from, and you can also select how far back you'd like to import existing data from.

## Set up Intercom integration

You can set up your Intercom integration from [Settings](https://dovetail.com/settings/integrations), when create a new Channel, or want to `Add source` to an existing channel set up in your workspace.

- To do this, open Settings or create a new channel and select **Intercom**. This will require you to review requested permissions and to accept, click `Authorize access`.

<Note>
  To connect an external data source, you'll need access to it to authorize the specific permissions that Dovetail requires. If you don't have the correct level of access and are unable to authorize, you'll need to reach out to an internal team that can provide you with the correct access.

## Import conversations automatically to Channels

Once you have connected your Intercom account to Dovetail, you can sync support tickets received in Intercom into a Channel where they will be automatically stored, analyzed, summarized and organized into themes.

- To do this, open or create a new Channel and add **Intercom** as a data source.
- Next, select the inboxes you wish to sync conversations from and how far back you'd like to import existing data from.
- From there, confirm set up and select **Finish**. Once complete, data from Intercom will start importing into your Channel and continue to sync new tickets into your Channel when received in Intercom.
