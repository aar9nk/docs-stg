Overview

Tie customer findings to product development and roadmaps by connecting your Productboard account to Dovetail. With this integration, you can send highlights and insights from a project to Productboard.

---

## Set up Productboard integration

- To connect your Productboard account, select [⚙️ Settings → Integrations](https://dovetail.com/settings/user/integrations) and navigate Productboard and select `Connect`. 
- From there, continue to login to your Productboard account and review requested permissions.

Please note you need to be on a paid Productboard plan that supports insights to be able to send Dovetail data to Productboard. At this time, we’re unable to show rich previews like highlights, videos, and images in Productboard at this time but will provide a link back to Dovetail to view the complete note, highlight or insight there.

## Send highlights to Productboard

After creating one or many highlights in your project, you can send these straight to Productboard.

- To do this, open `Highlights` in your project, select your highlights, click `•••` in the pop-up toolbar then select `Send to Productboard`.
- From there, a toast will appear with a link to the Productboard note that you've just created. You can now link this to features in your Productboard roadmap and get better visibility into customer impact.
- From there, open Productboard to view your highlights as new notes.

---

## Send insights to Productboard

- To send one or multiple insights to Productboard, open the insight, click `•••` then select `Send to Productboard`.
- Once selected, a toast will appear with a link to the Productboard insight that you've just created to confirm the send was successful. Don’t navigate away before the action has been completed, otherwise only some of your insights will be sent.
- From there, open Productboard to view your insight as new notes.

## Disconnect Dovetail and Productboard

- If you wish to disconnect your Productboard account from Dovetail, navigate to ⚙️ Settings → [Integrations](https://dovetailapp.com/settings/user/integrations) and locate Productboard in the list.
- From there, select `Disconnect` beside Productboard. Once disconnected, you'll no longer be able to send new highlights and insights using your account, however anything you've already sent will remain in Productboard.
