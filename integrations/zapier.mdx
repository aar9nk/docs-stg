## Overview

Dovetail has partnered with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to enable you to connect the other tools you use, like Slack, Intercom, and Google Forms to your Dovetail account. Using our integration with Zapier, you can connect your Dovetail account to your Zapier account to unlock powerful workflows and automations with the thousands of apps on Zapier’s platform.

---

## How it works

Zapier lets you connect apps together and move data around using automated workflows called Zaps.

Our Zapier integration has one Trigger and one Action to help you move data between Dovetail and other apps you use. Zapier allows you to design workflows based on triggers and actions that happen in Dovetail and other apps and tools.

For example, if you receive a new survey response in _Google Form_, this can be used to automatically create a _New note_ within a project. This note will contain all text content from the survey response.

Zapier has thousands of apps, so check out their [directory](https://zapier.com/apps/integrations) and search for the apps you use.

## Set up Zapier integration

You can connect your Zapier account to your Dovetail account under [Integrations](https://dovetail.com/settings/user/integrations) in ⚙️ Settings. From there, you will be directed to Zapier’s website to connect and Authorize access to create content in Dovetail.

If you do not have an existing Zapier account, visit [Zapier’s website](https://zapier.com/pricing) for more information.

## Zapier actions

Actions help you get data into Dovetail from other apps. For example, you could create notes from SurveyMonkey responses, connect an NPS tool like Delighted or AskNicely and create a note for each NPS response, or add people via a Google Form.

## Import data into Dovetail

To import data into a project, start by creating a Zap within your Zapier account. In this Zap, select the Trigger app and event. This is the app where the data will be coming from and what needs to occur in this app first.

For example, you could select app _Google Forms_ and event _New Form Response_.

From there, you will be directed to set the Action app and event. This is where you determine what you want create your data as in Dovetail. Depending on the Trigger app selected, actions you can choose are _Create note_, _Create insight_ or _Create person_.

For example, for our _New Form Response_, we will select _Create Note_ as our Action event.

The note/s that we’ll create will also need to be housed within a project, require a title and content. Insert this data directly from _Google Forms_ by selecting options from the dropdown menu.

Once you’ve completed set up, test your Zap to ensure it is successful before turning on.

## Export data from Dovetail

To export data from Dovetail, select Dovetail as the Trigger app and select an event. For example, when a _New Insight_ is created in Dovetail.

As notes and insights are housed in projects, select a specific project for the trigger event, or leave the project field blank for this Zap to trigger when a new insight is published in any project.

Once you’ve finished setting up the trigger, select your Action App and event. This is the app where you want your Dovetail data to go. The Action events available will depend on the specific app selected.

For example, you could push a _New insight_ into a specific Slack channel. This will create a message with a direct link to your insight.
