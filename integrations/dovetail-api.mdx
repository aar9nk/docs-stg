## \
Overview

The Dovetail API lets you extend Dovetail’s functionality beyond what we provide out of the box. Create your own scripts and applications that integrate with Dovetail to automate tasks, extract insights, and manage your data in an efficient manner.

Our API is available on Free, Professional, and Enterprise workspaces. Legacy Free, Pro, Personal Pro, Starter, and Team plans must [upgrade to a current plan](https://dovetail.com/help/upgrade-from-legacy-plan/) to gain access.

<Info>
  Check out our technical API documentation for a more in-depth explanation on what our API supports and the specifics of each read/write API endpoint. [View developer docs](https://developers.dovetail.com/)

## Get started with Dovetail's API

To get started, navigate to [Settings → Account](https://dovetail.com/settings/user/account), look for Personal API keys, and generate a token. This token will let you query and update data available to your user account. Data you do not have access to and actions that aren’t available to your user role will not be available when using your personal API key.
