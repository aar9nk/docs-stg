The word 'insight' has a variety of different definitions. In Dovetail, an insight is a specific object type where you summarize and share high-level project findings in a simple format.
Insights are a flexible way for you to present high-level findings from common themes and trace important quotes back to their original source. In this lesson, we will cover two common types of insights you can create in a project  â€“ an atomic finding or a formal research report. 




Insight as an atomic finding
The most common type of insight created by researchers in Dovetail is an atomic finding. Often referred to as a "nugget", an atomic finding represents a single, high-level finding from a project. This type of insight is useful for bringing together related pieces of evidence that contribute to any critical discoveries that require immediate attention or action.
These could look like:
A discovery about human behavior and the underlying motivations behind that behavior
Information that challenges what we believe about users and how they exist in the world
Knowledge that uncovers fundamental principles that drive us towards seeing users in a new way

If you decide to create insights as atomic findings, here are a few tips we recommend:
Contextualize â€“ Encourage teams to provide context when sharing single-finding insights. This can include background information, related findings, or how the insight fits into the larger picture of the project or organization. 
Link to broader goals â€“ Help teams understand how single findings connect to broader organizational objectives or customer needs. This can foster a more strategic approach to decision-making.
Encourage collaboration â€“ Promote discussions around single findings in team meetings or workshops to explore their implications and potential actions collaboratively. This can help mitigate the risks of oversimplification and cherry-picking.





Insight as a research report
The second most common insight is a research report. This typically is an in-depth summary of a single project with a collection of findings.

Insight as a product requirements doc
To drive action from your research, product teams can use insights to create and share a product requirements doc. As you can link decisions directly to evidence from customer conversations, using insights is a compelling way to align teams on what to build, why it matters, and how to measure success.
