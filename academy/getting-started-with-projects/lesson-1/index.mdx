### What is a project used for?

Projects are a space for you to thoroughly analyze data-rich sources like customer interviews, usability tests, sales calls, or surveys to draw very detailed insights.

Projects can also house existing research, so it's always on hand and able to be referenced by your team.

- To create a project, navigate to + New and select Project.
- From there, you can start from one of our templates or from a blank project. We recommend that you start from our Customer interviews template as it contains a simple starting set of tags that you can work with.

### Setting up magic automation

We know that analyzing qualitative data can be time-consuming. Projects help automate the repetitive parts of analysis and will do the work in transcribing any video or audio files upon import, generating summaries of your data, and surface notable quotes for you to review.

When creating a new project, Dovetail's AI Magic automation is turned on by default. You can decide how much AI you want working with your data by navigating to â€¢â€¢â€¢ in the top right corner of your project. Click on this to reveal a dropdown menu with several features and options.
