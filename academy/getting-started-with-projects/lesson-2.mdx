In this lesson, we will cover essential steps to set up your first channel up for success. You will learn how to identify key sources of continuous customer feedback at your organization, set up key integrations to sync data,  and




Map out sources of customer feedback at your organization
Channels can . Sync data from your existing tool stack. This could look like:
Support ticket platforms Front, Intercom, Jira Service Management, and Zendesk
App reviews from the Google Play store, Apple App store, and G2
In-product feedback collected via Pendo
Any feedback tool that has an integration with Zapier, or via our Public API

At larger organizations, its common you may need admin access to these tools to set up these integrations. We recommend working with your internal IT team to understand what integrations you will need to configure, share relevant help documentation and have them partner with you when setting up in Channels.
