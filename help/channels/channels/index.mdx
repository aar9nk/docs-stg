Channels overview

How Channels work
Channels continuously classifies and tracks themes in large data sets. This is done by connecting to your feedback sources with direct integrations to keep your finger on the pulse of high-volume customer feedback and gain real-time insights.
Channels is powered by generative AI. We build upon established technology from Anthropic, ensuring reliability and privacy, and utilize specific models to manage large data sets efficiently without training on your sensitive data.
Themes are generated from the individual data points imported into a channel. A data point is a single piece of feedback that is imported to a channel in Dovetail. It could be a support ticket, an NPS response, or any kind of continuous product feedback. A theme is a collection of data points with a title.
All Professional and Enterprise workspaces can import up to 250 data points per month and purchase additional data points by navigating to Settings â†’ Billing.




Create a new channel
Managers and Contributors can create a new channel sidebar under Home or Browse pages. You can create a channel to track themes in support tickets, CSAT/NPS responses, churn responses, app store reviews, and in-product reviews. 
To do this, click New and select Channel.
From there, import data via an available first-party integration, Zapier, or API. These options will automatically sync data into your channel. You can also import a CSV manually.

Add context to guide AI
In a channel, Dovetail generates high-level topics to organize and refine key themes from your data. You can enhance AI-driven topic generation by adding context. 
When creating a new channel, you will be instructed to provide details such as your role, specific goals, or key focus areas to create dynamic, tailored topics that align with what you're interested in. 
To do this, in the textbox under Context enter your details as a prompt. For better results, you can also refine your prompt using Enhance context.
Next, our AI will surface a list of auto-generated topics and descriptions based on your imported data and context. You can choose to keep, remove, or add your own topics. 
From there, confirm the topics for your channel and select Finish.

Create a topic, category, or area of interest

You can also remove a topic from your channel if it is no longer needed. When removed, this will also remove any themes created within it. Data points classified under these themes will remain in your Channel.
