## **Why use Dovetail?**

The ability to connect with customers is now effortless, thanks to an abundance of tools and a focus on customer-centricity. However, the real hurdle isn't talking, it's listening—and making sense of what you hear. Customer feedback is typically fragmented across diverse teams and systems, making rapid, meaningful analysis difficult. This often results in internal misalignment, redundant work, and decisions driven by gut feelings.

Dovetail empowers you to overcome these challenges. Our AI-native customer intelligence platform centralizes and analyzes customer feedback with the speed your business requires. This enables your teams to quickly uncover insights, effectively prioritize roadmaps, ensure compliance, and confidently make customer-driven decisions every day.

## **Where does Projects fit in my workflow?**

[<u>Projects</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/an-overview-of-projects/) are designed to fit into a researcher, designer, or product manager's existing workflow after conducting a round of customer calls, usability tests, or a survey.

### Centralizing raw customer data

- High-density data like customer interviews, usability tests, industry reports, and sales calls can all be brought into a project and contribute to richer research output.
- Dovetail [<u>integrates</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrations/) with tools like [<u>Google Drive</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/import-files-from-google-drive/), [<u>OneDrive</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/import-files-from-onedrive/), [<u>Zoom</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/import-zoom-cloud-recordings/), and [<u>Zapier</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/connect-apps-to-dovetail-with-zapier/), so bringing customer data into Projects from your existing tool stack is seamless.

### Making sense of themes in your data

- Raw data gathered after conducting customer research or receiving feedback can be analyzed and broken down into [<u>single quotes</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/highlight-and-tag-project-content/) in a project.
- Raw video or audio files are automatically [<u>transcribed</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/take-notes-and-upload-data/) and summarized by AI to break down long customer interviews or calls into actionable takeaways.
- [<u>Single quotes</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/highlight-and-tag-project-content/) highlighted in transcripts create short video or audio clips, removing time-consuming editing software and processes.

### Synthesizing and summarizing findings

- Analyzed data can be regrouped into themes on a [<u>canvas view</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/how-to-use-canvas-layout/), powered by AI. This is a whiteboard where you can collaborate with your team to map your single points, similar to Miro, or using Post-it notes.
- You can create a summary of your findings from your synthesis, which can be created directly into a [<u>report</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/summarize-and-present-insights/) within Dovetail.
- This report can contain a [<u>video or audio reel of short clips</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/curate-and-share-highlights-with-reels/) as a compelling way to bring your customer's voice to the forefront of your findings, connect recommendations to evidence, and gain trust and buy-in from your stakeholders.

### Sharing and presenting your findings

- Outputs of customer research can be shared and presented to stakeholders directly from Dovetail to balance data ethics and responsible management of PII.
- If your organization uses [<u>Slack</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/slack-integration/), [<u>Teams</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrations/microsoft-teams/), [<u>Notion</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrate-dovetail-with-notion/), [<u>Productboard</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrate-dovetail-with-productboard/), [<u>Atlassian</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrate-dovetail-with-atlassian/) (Jira, Confluence, or Trello), or [<u>Microsoft Teams</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrate-with-microsoft-teams/), you can use our integrations to share assets in tools that your stakeholders already work within.
- Enable stakeholders to query, chat with, and self-serve customer knowledge with [<u>chat</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/contextual-chat/) in Dovetail and [<u>Slack and Teams</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/ask-dovetail/) with our enhanced integrations.

## **Where does Channels fit in my workflow?**

[<u>Channels</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/channels/) are designed to fit into a designer's or product manager's existing workflow when looking to gather real-time insights from high-volume feedback quickly and efficiently to build their product roadmap.

### Centralizing raw customer data

- High-volume, low density feedback data like support tickets, NPS scores, in-app reviews, and app store reviews can all be synced into a purpose-built channel for that data type.
- Dovetail [<u>integrates</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrations/) with [<u>Zendesk</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrations/zendesk/), [<u>Intercom</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/integrations/intercom/), [<u>Zapier</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/connect-apps-to-dovetail-with-zapier/), and so bringing customer data into Channels from your organization's existing tool stack is seamless. You can also import data from any other app via CSV import.

### Identifying themes in your data

- Pieces of raw data imported into a Channel are used to automatically identify and group data into [<u>themes</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/channels/#how-channels-works). These themes are organized under pre-defined [<u>high-level topics</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/channels/#create-a-topic-category-or-area-of-interest) to help you quickly understand opportunities, pain points, and customer needs.
- To stay up to date with feedback related to a product, initiative or an area of accountability, you can define your own topics of interest. Work hand-in-hand with our engine to influence how themes are surfaced as they emerge into areas of interest defined by you.

### Driving action from findings

- Quickly see a breakdown of feature requests, jump into one of request themes, and generate a [<u>shareable doc</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/summarize-and-present-insights/#create-an-insight) to ensure your team stays aligned and focused on what matters.
- Enable stakeholders to query, chat with, and self-serve customer knowledge with [<u>chat</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/contextual-chat/) in Dovetail and [<u>Slack and Teams</u>](https://dovetail.com/help/ask-dovetail/) with our enhanced integrations.
